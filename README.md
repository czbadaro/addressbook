# ADDRESSBOOK APPLICATION

This spring boot app was made with Jdk 17. It basically loads a text file (in CSV format) from 
`/src/main/resources/addressbook/AddressBook.txt` and answer these 3 questions:

1. How many males are in the address book?
2. Who is the oldest person in the address book?
3. How many days older is Bill than Paul?

To run the application um can run as any other spring boot with the following commands:
`mvn clean install`
and then:
`mvn spring-boot:run`
